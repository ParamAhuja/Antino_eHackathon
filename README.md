Project submission for the Antino eSubmission

# The Problem
In India, more than Six Crore people suffer from hearing problems, and more than Ten Crore people suffer from speech related problems to some order.
- A Majority of communication-impared population use the *ASL or ISL, but the non-signers struggle to communicate with them.
- Existing solutions like human interpreters or text-based methods are not always accessible or efficient, and sometimes impractical
> The observation was made that the needs of those troubled by communication barriers are not always catered. So, there exists a need for a real-time, speech assistant solution powered by modern AI-technologies such as vision model.

# The Big Idea
Sonara is a web-based accessibility platform, designed to provide inclusivity to people with communication-impairments of varying orders.
- The project features real-time ASL-to-speech and speech-to-ASL conversion, through video-call. It also speech-recognition, ASL-tutoring and custom gesture recognition as additional features.
- Sonara will recognize various signs using the live web-cam footage, to detect the holistic landmarks on the hands, face and body and use those points as data to translate it into text (or to speech) using LSTM.
> The solution aims to bring the people a quality of life application, and enabling seamless-communication for all, no matter their predicament.
